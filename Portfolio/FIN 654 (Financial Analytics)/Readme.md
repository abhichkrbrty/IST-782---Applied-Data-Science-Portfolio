# FIN 654 Financial Analytics - VSE Simulation Project

## Project Overview
In the VSE (Virtual Stock Exchange) simulation exercise for FIN 654 Financial Analytics, I managed a trading portfolio from **September 24, 2024, to December 6, 2024**. Starting with an initial capital of **$100,000**, I engaged in strategic trades with a focus on maximizing returns while balancing portfolio risk.

- **Final Net Worth:** $111,307.20
- **Overall Gain:** $11,307.20 (11.31% Return)
- **Portfolio Rank:** #27 out of 155 participants

## Key Strategies

### Sector-Based Short Selling
- **Sectors Targeted:** Energy (XLE), Utilities (XLU), Healthcare (XLV)
- **Approach:**
  - Conducted market and sector-specific trend analysis.
  - Employed margin trading to leverage positions.

### Investment in SPY ETF
- **SPY (S&P 500 ETF):**
  - Purchased 344 shares initially.
  - Later constructed a minimum variance (MV) tangency portfolio using SPY as the sole asset.
  - Sold 345 shares at $607.99 to realize gains and rebalance portfolio.

### Risk and Return Optimization
- **Techniques Used:**
  - Efficient Frontier analysis
  - Single Index Model (SIM)
  - Alpha, Beta, Sigma, and Information Ratio (IR) calculations

### Portfolio Adjustments
- **Short Positions:**
  - **XLV:** Shorted 305 shares
  - **XLU:** Shorted 263 shares
  - **XLE:** Shorted 623 shares
- **Capital Reinvestment:**
  - Funds from short selling and partial SPY sale were allocated to optimize the minimum variance portfolio.

## Analysis and Results

### Efficient Frontier and Tangency Portfolio
- Used the Efficient Frontier graph to determine the best risk-return tradeoff.
- Identified the Tangency Portfolio to maximize the Sharpe Ratio.

### Portfolio Performance (Sharpe Ratio Analysis)
- **Observation:**
  - Steady growth in returns during the initial phase.
  - Sharp drop in early November due to recalibration.
  - Strong recovery by December, culminating in a solid 11.31% return.

### Risk Management
- Continuous risk evaluation using:
  - Value at Risk (VaR)
  - Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR)

---

## Tools and Technologies
- **Software:** R Programming Language
- **Analysis Conducted:**
  - Alpha, Beta, Sigma, IR calculations
  - Portfolio covariance matrices
  - Data visualization (Sharpe Ratio graph)

---

## Key Learnings
- Dynamic strategy adjustment is crucial during periods of volatility.
- Short selling based on strong risk-adjusted metrics enhances portfolio performance.
- Leveraging quantitative models like Efficient Frontier and SIM significantly improves risk-return management.

---

## Future Improvements
- Integrating machine learning-based portfolio optimization techniques.
- Enhancing real-time risk tracking with automated alerts.
- Expanding to multi-asset class portfolios (bonds, commodities, crypto).
